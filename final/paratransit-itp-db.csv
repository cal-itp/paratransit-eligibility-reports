Originally approved in 2012, the shuttle was delayed for several years after the project lost its federal funding. Last year, the Contra Costa Transportation Authority committed $471,841 for the shuttle from Measure J funds, the half-cent sales tax that pays for transportation projects in Contra Costa County.

Although the money is expected to last just two years, Van Hofwegen said the organizations that collaborated on the shuttle service want to extend it. The two-year period provides time to establish a track record and demonstrate the need for a free shuttle in the Monument community which may help the group secure additional funding, he added.",suspect-gtfs,,,,,2017-01-19 05:36:30,2017-06-26 19:08:38,Seth Churnside,N,,"2 daily, 1 Tuesday night",N,,,Trillium contact,Contra Costa,,Contra Costa Transportation Authority,Metropolitan Transportation Commission,Metropolitan Transportation Commission,4,04 - Oakland,,,,,,
